# $Id$

1.37 - Mon Jun  1 00:20:54 2009
	* Fix #46335: qualify calls to find() so Module::Install
	doesn't intercept them.

1.035 - Sat Aug  2 23:24:14 2008
	* Cleaning up the Makefile a bit. No need to upgrade.

1.034 - Sat Jul 12 21:32:16 2008
	* Various minor cleanups. No bg whoop.

1.033 - Fri Mar 16 23:00:57 2007
	* Fixed load test to not complain when trying to import the same
	symbol twice
	* No code fixes otherwise. No need to upgrade.

1.032 - Tue Jan  9 22:54:40 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.031 - Wed May 17 22:23:23 2006
	* updates to distro and kwalitee. No need to upgrade

	* Updates to distro and kwalitee. No need to upgrade.

1.30 - Wed Jan 11 00:11:21 2006
	* Tests should now work even if there is nothing in PREREQ_PM. In the
	previous version, an empty PREREQ_PM made the module think Makefile.PL
	didn't exit cleanly. 
	* Everyone should upgrade.

1.29 - Sun Dec 25 20:03:47 2005
	* Updated some tests that had some problems. No need to upgrade.

	* Simple doc fixes. No need to upgrade.

1.027 - Tue Mar  8 00:18:28 2005
	* fixed up the bits that deal with the plan, to make things
	consistent. prereq_ok will create the plan if it doesn't
	exist, or leave it alone if it does.
	* You don't need to use Test::More (and you didn't need
	to previously, despite the docs)

1.026 - Fri Mar  4 08:09:41 2005
	* Documentation fix for command line invocation: Test::Prereq
	calls plan() for you, so you don't have to.

1.025 - Wed Sep  8 00:59:57 2004
	* get rid of the 'redefine' warning when we read the Makefile.PL

1.024 - Tue Sep  7 19:52:30 2004
	* cleaned up distro
	* bumped version to a full release (the interface is pretty much set)

	version number above 1.x

	figured this out. 
	
0.17 Wed Oct 23 11:55:28 CDT 2002
