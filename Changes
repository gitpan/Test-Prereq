	* Cleaning up the Makefile a bit. No need to upgrade.

1.034 - Sat Jul 12 21:32:16 2008

1.030 - Wed Jan 11 00:11:21 2006
	* Tests should now work even if there is nothing in PREREQ_PM. In the
	previous version, an empty PREREQ_PM made the module think Makefile.PL
	didn't exit cleanly.

	* Updated some tests that had some problems. No need to upgrade.

	exist, or leave it alone if it does.
	* You don't need to use Test::More (and you didn't need
	to previously, despite the docs)

1.026 - Fri Mar  4 08:09:41 2005

	calls plan() for you, so you don't have to.
