1.027 - Tue Mar  8 00:18:28 2005
	* fixed up the bits that deal with the plan, to make things
	consistent. prereq_ok will create the plan if it doesn't
	exist, or leave it alone if it does.
	* You don't need to use Test::More (and you didn't need
	to previously, despite the docs)

1.026 - Fri Mar  4 08:09:41 2005
* Documentation fix for command line invocation: Test::Prereq
calls plan() for you, so you don't have to.

* get rid of the 'redefine' warning when we read the Makefile.PL

1.024 - Tue Sep  7 19:52:30 2004

version number above 1.x
